# BashScripts

Collection of bash scripts I have made for situations that I need them for, some you might find useful. 

## Collection

### Backup Scripts

- backup-www: Used to backup the `/var/www/` folder and 1 MySQL DB.

### Hard Drive Scripts

- dscript: A `dd` script for simple copying/cloning/erasing of drives. Includes progress and status of `dd`. Does not use `status=progress` so can be used on older systems. Not tested on MAC OSX.

### Misc Scripts

- TKL-Jenkins: TurnKey Linux Jenkins automated build script. Used to build TKL Appliances automatically and number them. This script builds an ISO for the appliance as well.
